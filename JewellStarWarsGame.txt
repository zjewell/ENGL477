	In an effort to simulate the experience of living through a pandemic and explore the potential of video games as a medium for DH practice, I created a simple game using Code Studio. You can find and play the game here, and you can read my reflection on the experience of creating and playing the game below.

        Once I learned how to click the ‘commands’ and ‘events’ tabs on the Hour of Code site, it was easy to create the game. I thought it was an interesting challenge working within the limitations of the code widgets to create the game; there weren’t enough options to create the game concept I had in my head. Knowing I could multiply game characters was the most important piece of knowledge I had, so I focused on how that could be best used to represent the pandemic. My game focuses on two aspects of the pandemic: how COVID spreads through contact and how vigilant you must be to mitigate its impact. The goal of my game is to remove all probots (representative of the virus) from the screen. This seems impossible at first: as soon as you remove one, two appear in its stead. Chasing the ‘virus’ around haphazardly trying to eradicate it only increases the rate of its spread (via contact) until it consumes your entire screen. To win, you must distance yourself from the two initially spawned probots, waiting until their hitboxes overlap to strike, which demonstrates the importance of social distancing.
