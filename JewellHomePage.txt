	Welcome to Exploring the Digital Humanities! The purpose of this blog is to examining different aspects of Digital Humanities, namely the impact and use of technology in both academic and everyday environments. Currently, the scope of this blog is limited to exploring the impact COVID-19 has on the learning/social environment of UNL as classes migrate from physical classrooms to digital platforms, as well as exploring some of the digital tools available for DH practitioners. You can find the posts currently on the blog by navigating the sidebar on the left or by clicking the links below. 
       As of October 16th, the blog also features documentation and exploration of the pandemic's effect on downtown Lincoln, and the exploration of DH tools has been expanded to include StoryMap, GeoJSON, and analog technology. 
        As of  November 17th, the blog includes brief explorations of the history of the relationship between the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Native American tribes with regard to Social Justice and the Digital Humanities and the the Black Lives Matter protests in Lincoln and the police response to them. Additionally, the site includes my experience participating in and documenting part of the DH process.
