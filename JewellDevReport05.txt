	The relationship between StoryMap and GeoJSON was like that between Blogger and WordPress: one was easier to use but more restrictive in what users could accomplish with it. Additionally, StoryMap is a better narrative tool while GeoJSON is a better visualization tool. Analog technology is unlike any other we've used this semester because it gives the user more freedom than any other medium. 

	I found StoryMap to be a more intuitive tool than GeoJSON, especially when it comes to constructing visual or spatial narratives. The narrative aspect of visualization was built in to StoryMap (it does have  'story' in its name), but that was not the case for GeoJSON. The way that StoryMap operated similar to a slideshow gave it a sense of temporality that I did not feel was evident in GeoJSON. I think this is due largely in part to the different levels of technological literacy required to use the platforms. Graham states, "when technological givens for some are unknowns for others, even the visible can be illegible." In this case, I think that the narrative becomes "invisible" when an user who does not have much experience with JSON or similar technologies tries to create a narrative using that medium. This invisibility is not present in StoryMap, however, because it is much easier to use. That said, I think GeoJSON has the potential to be a better visualization tool than StoryMap when used to its full potential. You can display more data via GeoJSON and include personalized code, which gives users considerably more freedom in their creation of visualizations. 

	Analog technologies are very strange in comparison to the digital technologies we've used this semester. For much of the digital technologies, the relationship between accessibility and complexity in an inverse one: the easier a technology is to use, the less complex it tends to be, which means it is more restrictive in what it can do. Analog, however, is extremely easy to use—you can convey visualizations and narratives even if they aren't artistic masterpieces—and the complexity and freedom afforded to you by the analog is greater than that of digital technologies. The one area where I think analog excels, especially compared to StoryMap and GeoJSON is in 3-dimensional representations and simultaneity. In StoryMap and GeoJSON, you can only display one set of information at a time in two dimensions, but in analog you can show everything at once in three dimensions and still convey temporality.
